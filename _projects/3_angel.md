### Architectural Goals

- **Zero-Copy In-GPU Weight Sharing:** Direct memory pointer swapping between PyTorch FSDP training ranks and inference execution backends without moving parameters across PCIe or disk.
- **Asynchronous Train/Rollout Pipelining:** Double-buffered generation queues where the rollout engine generates batch $D_{t+1}$ on an asynchronous CUDA stream while the training ranks compute the backward pass on batch $D_t$.
- **Space-Multiplexed GPU Partitioning:** Support for hybrid cluster allocation (e.g. 6 training GPUs + 2 dedicated vLLM rollout GPUs) with background NCCL weight broadcasts.
- **Online Speculative Decoding:** Integrating Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) draft training during RL execution to double rollout generation throughput.
